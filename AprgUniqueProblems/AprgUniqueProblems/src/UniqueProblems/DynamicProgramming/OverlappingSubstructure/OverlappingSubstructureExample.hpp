// 2) Optimal Substructure:
// A given problems has Optimal Substructure Property if optimal solution of the given problem
// can be obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems.
// For example, the Shortest Path problem has following optimal substructure property:
// If a node x lies in the shortest path from a source node u to destination node v then
// the shortest path from u to v is combination of shortest path from u to x and shortest path from x to v.
// The standard All Pair Shortest Path algorithm like Floyd–Warshall and Single Source Shortest path algorithm
// for negative weight edges like Bellman–Ford are typical examples of Dynamic Programming.
// On the other hand, the Longest Path problem doesn’t have the Optimal Substructure property.
// Here by Longest Path we mean longest simple path (path without cycle) between two nodes.
// Consider the following unweighted graph given in the CLRS book.
// There are two longest paths from q to t: q→r→t and q→s→t.
// Unlike shortest paths, these longest paths do not have the optimal substructure property.
// For example, the longest path q→r→t is not a combination of longest path from q to r and longest path from r to t,
// because the longest path from q to r is q→s→t→r and the longest path from r to t is r→q→s→t.
